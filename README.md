# Mineral Catalog

This is Treehouse Techdegree Project for Unit 6.

This app is a website to show information about various minerals. The home page of the site contains a list of all of the minerals in a database. Clicking on a mineralâ€™s name opens a page that displays information about the mineral.

This is built with django and there is requirements.txt for dependencies.
